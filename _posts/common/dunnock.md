I remember that it is a bird I learned
I only learned the seep call last year


Dunnock song, defining feature is it's unassuming
dubbe de dee, dubee de derr (memory of learning seep call)
Starlings feeding
That wren still prattling, sounds more like a dunnock/wren cross now than just a loose jangle
cf Whitethroat jangle - forthright, like a coronation street woman, "And that's that!"
