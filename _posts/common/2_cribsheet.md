Today, for me, even more than yesterday, is what this blog's all about. Going looking for something common but magnificent (the song thrush), accept the playful substitue (the sedge warbler), draw within touching distance of a superstar (the hobby), and yet find the most pleasure in the familiar and understated swallow.

Even when the world of birds is stood relatively still, nature's serendipitous paw has plenty of gems to reveal. If only we give our eyes and ears willingly to it.

The hobby is the hunter of swiftsâ€¦ and dragonflies (damsels)
My first sight of a hobby was one of those unverified optimistic teenage moments. One for there to be confirmed list. The second sighting was of magical dragon birds in Reading. Boats life is not unlike lockdown. I am developing a stoop
 It's no longer the child star.
