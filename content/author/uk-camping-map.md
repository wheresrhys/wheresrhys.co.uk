My campsite search engine, using **Google Maps, jquery, CodeIgniter** and **MySQL**. Among its more unique features are 3-way 'radio buttons' (yes, no and maybe), and incremental adding of points to the map as the user zooms in (most other sites opt for plotting clusters at lower zoom levels because it's a lot easier).
