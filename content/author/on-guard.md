A configurable app to call out martial art commands (like in the courtyard in 'Enter the dragon'). I wrote my own **event emitter** and loosely-coupled visualiser and control panel, and used **require.js** to create an app that will be easily extensible in future. The app is also covered by **jasmine** tests (using **grunt** and **istanbul** to run them). And, true to the ways of the ninja, there's **no-jQuery** to be found
