The FastFT news streaming site was the testing ground for a number of technologies at the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com), all of which I played a central role in developing. These include:

* The [Origami](http://origami.ft.com/) front-end component library (developed with one eye on an easy upgrade path to **web components**), for which I worked on both drawing up the [specifications](http://origami.ft.com/docs/component-spec/) and developed many of the core [components](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components) ([github](https://github.com/Financial-Times/?query=o-))
* **Responsive, progressively enhanced and performance-centred design** to deal with the growing diversity of internet devices (with jquery banished from the codebase!) 
* Consuming content APIs and using **nodejs** for the entire presentation tier (later developed further for [FT Next](https://github.com/Financial-Times/?query=next-))
* Rapid deployment using **continuous integration** and online/offline switches
