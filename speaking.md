## A field guide to the Financial Times (neo4j graph tour, London, March 2019)
The FT was a microservices pioneer, and our teams had a lot of freedom to pick the tools & processes they wanted. 5 years on, many people have moved on and those innovative projects are now legacy code. Iâ€™ll tell you about our journey, using neo4j & graphQL, towards keeping track of it all.

## Speeding up without slowing down (DeltaV Conf, London, May 2018)
At FT we built one of the world's fastest media websites, and release to production dozens of times a day. But the architectural and organisational decisions aimed at allowing us to deliver reliable features quickly and consistently don't always fit neatly with the desire to optimise performance.

In this warts-and-all talk, you'll learn

- how we build FT.com
- how a highly componentised, microservices stack with a rapid release cycle can sometimes get in the way of performance
- some ideas for working around these obstacles
- that web performance is hard, and no-one's perfect
