<p>A configurable app to call out martial art commands (like in the courtyard in &#39;Enter the dragon&#39;). I wrote my own <strong>event emitter</strong> and loosely-coupled visualiser and control panel, and used <strong>require.js</strong> to create an app that will be easily extensible in future. The app is also covered by <strong>jasmine</strong> tests (using <strong>grunt</strong> and <strong>istanbul</strong> to run them). And, true to the ways of the ninja, there&#39;s <strong>no-jQuery</strong> to be found</p>
