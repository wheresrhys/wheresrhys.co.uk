Hello, I'm Rhys.

I strugle to say what I am these days, but I've been a front-end developer, a web performance specialist, worked on a data and analytics platform, written lots of devleoper tooling, and now find myself working in my employer's version of a Site Reliabilty Engineering team. My employer's the [FT](www.ft.com), by the way.

I like to think I've carried over a lot of the experience and knowledge of my previous incarnations along with me, and now do a passable job of tackling any tech problem that's put in front of me and the teams I lead.

I would do anything for love, but I won't transpile.

I would _love it_ if you donated some money to [Refugee Support](https://www.refugeesupport.eu/donate/), a charity very close to my heart.
