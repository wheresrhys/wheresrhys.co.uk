# How to choose a process

Need to agree on a process, buy in (cf lily dart)

Need to choose the best

=> need to measure the best

What is good measure of success of process

- throughput
- ability to iterate
- profit
- targets

NO

These things are what good process is a foundation for, but they can fail to happen even if process is good (e.g. maybe the main idea is pants)

Success of process hould be measured by ability to feedback and decide when something needs to be done differently

All a bit meta



# Don't solve the problem

Why we shouldn't tackle problems

- Evans's first law
    - A problem that takes more than five minutes to think of a solution isn't worth solving

Obviously not true... But if you avoid solving those problems that take more than 5 minutes to think of a solution (not necessarily to implement) then you end up dedicating so much more of your time to useful endeavour. Eventually a problem which falls outside this category, through gradual changing of the landscape and subconscious absorbing, may fall within it and become worth solving
