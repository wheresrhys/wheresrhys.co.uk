<p>The FastFT news streaming site was the testing ground for a number of technologies at the <a href="http://www.ft.com">Financial Times</a>, all of which I played a central role in developing. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://origami.ft.com/">Origami</a> front-end component library (developed with one eye on an easy upgrade path to <strong>web components</strong>), for which I worked on both drawing up the <a href="http://origami.ft.com/docs/component-spec/">specifications</a> and developed many of the core <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components">components</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/?query=o-">github</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Responsive, progressively enhanced and performance-centred design</strong> to deal with the growing diversity of internet devices (with jquery banished from the codebase!) </li>
<li>Consuming content APIs and using <strong>nodejs</strong> for the entire presentation tier (later developed further for <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/?query=next-">FT Next</a>)</li>
<li>Rapid deployment using <strong>continuous integration</strong> and online/offline switches</li>
</ul>
