My boss, of sorts, wrote a very nice post and, a rarity, caused me to look up a non-programming word's definition.

at FT we use flags to expire features, works well...ish. Has taken a long time to get there, still imperfect

what about expired APIs

they hang around for a LON LONG time

can we write tests for this?

Yes

if(v > 1) { // alternatively, if date > thing
    if (nUi.thing) {
    fail
}
}
