#Taking ownership

Ever since getting involved with web development - going right back to the days when all I did was clean up html copy & pasted from word andd was introduced to firefox, a web browser ("what's a web browser?") that doesn't break - I've loved the idea of open source. And not just the idea, I also love the reality, that the vast majority of the tools and libraries I use daily are completely open source.

I should start with a disclaimer and own up to having made more than my fair share of ill-informed bug reports, poorly executed patches and misguided new features

what happens when an open source project starts to get a build up of legitimate pull requests unpulled

or a poorly executed app needs to be rewritten e.g. colorbox.

suffers from teh myth of the free market having perfect knowledge

I think with the advent of distributed versioning tools such as git moer distributed ownership of open source projects could be a reality. What if github gave more equal prmoinence to all forks of a project... or perhaps prominence based on age and amount of activity/likes

Is this a witch hunt? No. It's a plea for people to share ownership of their project sif they become too popular for them to maintain alone
